# AlgoView-Algorithm-Visualizer

A web-based interactive tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that visualizes algorithms in real-time. Features include dynamic speed control, intuitive UI with hover effects, audio controls, and animations to enhance the user experience. 

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Customizable:
  - Change the speed of visualization.
  - Adjust the number of array elements.
  - Generate new random arrays.
- Interactive controls to **start** and **stop** sorting at any time.
- **Mute** and **unmute** background music.
- Fully responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the sorting algorithms and interactivity.

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
This is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort works similarly to how you would sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part, and values from the unsorted part are picked and placed in the correct position in the sorted part.

### 3. Selection Sort
The algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

## How to Use

1. **Generate a new array**: Click on the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array.
2. **Choose a sorting algorithm**: Select any of the available algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort).
3. **Adjust speed**: Use the speed slider to control how fast or slow the visualization runs.
4. **Adjust array size**: Use the array slider to change the number of elements in the array.
5. **Mute/Unmute music**: Click on the speaker icon to toggle background music.
6. **Stop the process**: Press the "Stop" button at any time to halt the ongoing sorting process.
